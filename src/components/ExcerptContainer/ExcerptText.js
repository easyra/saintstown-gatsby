        I am reminded of the times when I would get my hair plaited and the
        twisting of hair to make this tight fitted braid down my scalp and the
        pain that came with it. Despite the pain and time it took, I was fly. I
        mention this because the understanding of the Hebrew word for “WAIT” is
        the same for “to plait the hair”, to intertwine sections of hair
        together so that it is tight. Can you picture it? When we plait hair, it
        is no longer free to be loose because it is tightened and made stronger,
        just like US. So, WAITING is not passive. It is serving like a waiter
        but also intertwining our lives together in Spirit. Dear Future Wife, we
        must plait our everyday with The Most High so that we are intertwined
        and made stronger.

        One of my favorite stories in the bible is when Abraham's servant goes
        to find a wife for his master's son Isaac. When he finds her by way of a
        specific prayer, he prays to his master's God that he may recognize her,
        because he himself was not a believer. The prayer would be for the woman
        to say the exact words to him at the drinking well, “I will also give
        your camels a drink.” It is Rebecca and she spoke exactly what he prays
        she would say, confirming destiny. He goes to her family and explains
        his master’s desires. They agree and ask for 10 days before she leaves
        on her journey to go to her future husband. In context of the time, a
        daughter/woman had no rights to make choices, but they asked her anyway
        and she chose to go. Rebecca chooses to go with the servant and Isaac
        takes her and loves her. She knows something, she takes a risk. I know
        this may sound a little crazy. He was a stranger but are not we all
        strangers waiting to meet and fall in love. I like the story because of
        the specific prayer and that she chose him and ran into his arms;
        something every man wants.

        I am seeking you, Dear Future Wife, because of the vision The Most High
        has for me in His desire for love and not just because I am lonely.
        Please do not get it twisted. I can do love all by myself because I love
        me first and foremost. Wow, that sounds defensive. What I mean is that I
        love myself first and I know how many people will fall back on that
        “loving yourself is all you need” to not feel lonely and desperate. Do
        not do that. I choose to have and want a partner because of the
        commitment The Most High commanded when She created love for the sake of
        love, so that we can love each other as a demonstration of His love and
        vision for all of us. I want this book to trace my story of what I see
        love as being, how love has evolved in my journey and what I want love
        to become for me and my Dear Future Wife. I want you to know and for
        other men to know that a man being vulnerable is one of our most natural
        and sexiest qualities. So, men take notice; women find this attractive.
        I want to be transparent, more for myself than anyone else. I am sharing
        this so that younger people may see from me that certain things happen
        because we do not know that we do not know. Now, over the age of fifty,
        in my last meaningful relationship I realized that no matter your age
        trauma must be healed. Although I am not perfect, I want to do the work.
        I want to open up to her in a way that she knows, without a shadow of a
        doubt, that when I say; I like you, I see you, I got you and ultimately,
        I want you, she knows it. So, I can then one day say those other
        important three words.....Be My Partner.
