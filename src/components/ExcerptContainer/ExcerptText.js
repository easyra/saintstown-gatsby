        I am reminded of the times when I would get my hair plaited and the
        twisting of hair to make this tight fitted braid down my scalp and the
        pain that came with it. Despite the pain and time, it took, I was fly. I
        mention this because the understanding of the Hebrew word for “WAIT” is
        the same for “to plait the hair”, to intertwine section of hair together
        so that is tight. Can you picture it? When we plait hair, it is no
        longer free to be loose because it is tightened and made stronger. So,
        WAITING is not passive. It is serving like a waiter but also
        intertwining our lives together with Yahawah (God). Dear Future Wife
        (DFW), we must plait our everyday with The Most High (TMH) so that are
        intertwined is made stronger.

        One of my favorite stories in the bible is when Abraham's servant goes
        to find a wife for his master's son Isaac. When he finds her by way of a
        specific prayer, he prays to his master's El because he himself was not
        a believer. It is Rebecca and she does exactly what he prays she would
        do, confirming destiny. He goes to her family and explains his master’s
        desires. They agree and ask for 10 days before she leaves on her journey
        to go to her future husband. In context of the time, a daughter/woman
        had no rights to make choices, but they ask her anyway and she chooses
        to go. Rebecca chooses to go with the servant and Isaac takes her and
        loves her. She knows something, she takes a risk. I know this may sound
        a little crazy. He was a stranger but are not we all strangers waiting
        to meet and fall in love. I like the story because of the specific
        prayer and that she chose him and ran into his arms; something every man
        wants.

        I am seeking you, DFW, because of the vision The Most High has for me in
        His desire for love and not just because I am lonely. Please do not get
        it twisted. I can do love all by myself because I love me first and
        foremost. Wow, that sounds defensive. What I mean is that I love myself
        first and I know how many people will fall back on that “loving yourself
        is all you need” to not feel lonely and desperate. Do not do that. I
        choose to have and want a partner because of the commitment Elohim
        commanded when She created love for the sake of love, so that we can
        love each other as a demonstration of His love and vision for all of us.
        I want this book to trace my story of what I see love as being, how love
        has evolved in my journey and what I want love to become for me and my
        DFW. I want you to know and for other men to know that a man being
        vulnerable is one of our most natural and sexiest qualities. So, men
        take notice; women find this attractive. I want to be transparent, more
        for myself than anyone else. I want to open up to her in a way that she
        knows, without a shadow of a doubt, that when I say; I like you, I see
        you, I got you and ultimately, I want you, she knows it. So, I can then
        one day say those other important three words.....Be My Partner.{" "}
