        The wind spoke in subtle whispers, its breath causing the tall blades of
        grass to lean to one side. The birds glide over the field in complete
        security no harm comes to those who roam in this place. The center of
        the field stands a large oak, its branches extending into the
        stratosphere. Alimayu leans gently against the tree, his lean dark
        muscular frame resting against its trunk. He wipes the perspiration from
        his forehead and regains control of his breathing. He would run almost
        six miles to get to this place. Removing the oversized “Rasta” cap from
        his head, a waterfall of dark brown godly dreadlocks tumble onto his
        face. Moving the hair form his eyes, he turns to face his childhood
        companion.
      </p>
      <p>
        “It’s been a long time old friend,” he says. Alimayu hands slowly
        rubbing the jagged bark, “It felt as though I needed to see you before I
        returned to school for I am not coming back. It’s time for me to receive
        my calling in the world.
      </p>
      <p>
        Alimayu sits on one of the tree’s protruding roots trying to understand
        the spirits churning within his soul. His hands begin to move across his
        face. He feels the rounded Solomon thickness of his lips, the unyielding
        width of his Moses nose, and the soft kinky lamp texture of his Yahsua
        hair. Was the world ready for such a blunt example of El?
      </p>
      <p>
        He gazes into the turquoise colored sky, watching the ivory clouds drift
        towards the horizon. Things always seemed to be alive in this field. The
        colors were bright and filled with energy that exploded into the air,
        making breathing more of an adventure than a necessity. In the real
        world everything was distant, cold...white. Color was not a thing of joy
        or power, it was a curse. Alimayu felt cursed.
      </p>
      <p>
        “How can I expect to survive in a world where I’m viewed as some sort of
        inferior creature? Where my very existence is associated with criminal
        statistics, and my might submerged in white sex fantasies,” Alimayu
        looks into the heavens for answers there is a timely reply.
      </p>
      <p>
        His mind begins to drift off, slowly toward the past. Alimayu’s mother,
        kneeling in the exact place where he sits, looking into the clouds,
        tonguing with Yah and his father sat on the protruding root writing for
        hours and hours. The tree seems to connect the ground he sits on to the
        universe. The tree’s limbs wrapping around the sun grasping Alimayu in
        an eternal hug, coupling the earth with the cosmos. Alimayu’s father
        would ponder such spiritual ideas. He made even the most cryptic images
        sound so beautifully real. “We are of the universe. The stars, sun and
        earth float within our dark boundaries. We are children of the sun. Her
        energy drawn to our Blackness, we are children of the Most High. All
        things live because we live.”
      </p>
      <p>
        “What does this have to do with my disturbance? How can any of this help
        a Black man living in a racist world?” Alimayu is baffle. His father’s
        ideas had always confused him as child, so why were they coming to haunt
        him at this moment?
      </p>
      <p>Earth</p>
      <p>
        An unfamiliar spirit began to move within Alimayu’s soul. Looking down
        at the ground beneath him, Alimayu began to slowly pluck away the blades
        of the green grass. With each detaching his spine began to straighten,
        his senses became more alert. In time he created a large patch of
        fertile soil. Plunging both hands into the ground, he felt warmth shoot
        through his veins, making him stronger. He stared at the substance in
        complete amazement. “We are one,” he realizes, observing the color of
        the earth is the same as that of his skin.
      </p>
      <p>
        He brings the soil to his face. He smells it. The sweet scent takes his
        soul back to times and places he never knew.
      </p>
      <p>
        Strong black spirits, levitating large stones across an Egyptian desert
        and women, dark as coal dancing around a fire, its flames rise and fall
        with each tribal chant, warriors fighting against decadent hands to
        maintain their life force. Freedom ships loads of people’s arms, legs,
        and souls in shackles, strong black spirits working as slaves on a
        plantation their pain creating the “amazing grace” and “weepin willow,”
        a new kind of spirit.
      </p>
      <p>
        Alimayu pauses for a brief second, noticing the change taking place
        within his soul. Its rhythms begin to coincide with that of the earth
        and the wind, creating beautifully complex musical vibration that would
        make even Coltrane enviable.
      </p>
      <p>
        He looks at his soiled hands and begins to rub the earth’s remains into
        his dreaded crown. His soul throbs with the funky tempo of his black
        spirit. He then walks into Yah’s world, ready for love.
