          You will be amazed at how things fall into place after letting go of
          past hurts and pain, attachments, false expectations and fear; as we
          learn to wait on Spirit as Abraham did.

        I remember when I would get my hair plaited and then twisted to make a
        tight fitted braid down my scalp; and the pain that came with it.
        Despite the pain and time, it took, I was fly, so I continued to do it.
        I mention this because the understanding of the Hebrew word for “WAIT”
        is the same for “to plait the hair”, to intertwine sections of hair
        together so that is tight. Can you picture it? When we plait hair, it is
        no longer free to be loose because it is tightened and made stronger,
        just like US. So, WAITING is not passive. It is serving like a waiter
        but also intertwining our lives together in Spirit.

          We must plait our every day with The Most High so that are intertwined
          is made stronger.

        One of my favorite stories in the bible is when Abraham’s servant goes
        to find a wife for his master’s son, Isaac. He asks to find her by way
        of a specific prayer, praying to his master’s God that he may recognize
        her, because he himself was not a believer. He asked that the woman say,
        at the drinking well, “I will also give your camels a drink.” Lo and
        behold, Rebecca spoke exactly those words, confirming destiny. He then
        goes to her family and explains his master’s desires. They agree.
        Rebecca leaves with the servant. Upon meeting Isaac though a stranger,
        she ran into his arms, something every man wants; and he in return,
        takes her and loves her. It was a risk, but she somehow felt what was
        destined to be. Though the story does not reveal it, I have a feeling
        she, too, had her own specific prayer, which made her free to take a
        risk.

        Because of the vision The Most High has for me in His desire for love,
        and not just because I am lonely. I love myself, yet I also desire the
        love of another, my other. That is different than being lonely or
        desperate. The Most High commands and expects us, men, and women to love
        for the sake of love, demonstrating His/Her love and vision for each of
        us.

        I want to open up to my woman in a way that she knows, without a shadow
        of a doubt, that when I say; I like you, I see you, I got you and
        ultimately, I want you, she knows it.
