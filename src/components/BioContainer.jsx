      <h1>Randall Courtland Davis</h1>
      <p>
        Randall Courtland Davis is a graduate of Clark Atlanta University with a
        major in Public Relations and a minor in Theater Arts. He obtained a job
        in International Marketing at Warner Brothers upon graduation. He was
        soon promoted into television and film production working as second
        assistant to Ilene Chaiken, President of Quincy Jones Entertainment.

        A year later, Mr. Davis became the Production Coordinator on the Martin
        Show for HBO for its first season. He further found his voice while
        taking advanced courses in screenwriting with Robert McKee while
        simultaneously rising to the top of his management roles in the service
        industry in Los Angeles for the last twenty-eight years. He continued to
        hone his craft by educating himself through the reading, writing, and
        studying of scripts from every genre. The genre he found most
        fascinating was dramatic expression as it resonated with his soul and
        history. He then worked 3 years in the Non-Profit sector for “My
        Friend's House Foundation” as its Director of Operations while
        simultaneously being a single father to three young children, now young
        adults.

        short film, and three original television pilots; a sitcom and two
        hour-long dramas. He now looks to find his tribe and to partner on a
        production deal to package his life’s work, share his talents and
